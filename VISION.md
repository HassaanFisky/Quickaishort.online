# Quick AI Shorts — Vision & Roadmap

Where we're going and why it matters.

Hum kahan ja rahe hain aur kyun.

---

## The Mission

Make repackaging long video into vertical Shorts effortless and human.

Long video ko vertical Shorts mein convert karna effortless aur human banana.

---

## The Belief

Creators are the new media companies. But they're drowning in busywork.

The best ideas are locked in 2-hour podcasts, hour-long streams, and massive backlogs of content that will never be repurposed.

We believe every creator deserves a tool that handles the grind — so they can focus on the craft.

Creators naye media companies hain. Lekin woh busywork mein doob rahe hain. Best ideas lambi videos mein locked hain jo koi repurpose nahi karega. Har creator ko ek tool milna chahiye jo grind handle kare.

## The Principles

### 1. Automation + Control

AI does heavy lifting. You make final decisions.

We will never ship a feature that removes creator agency. AI suggests. You choose.

AI heavy lifting karega. Final decision tumhari.

### 2. Speed-First

Every feature is measured by time saved.

If a feature adds complexity without reducing friction, we cut it.

Har feature time save ke basis pe measure hota hai.

### 3. Design-First Output

The output should look like it came from a professional studio.

No janky fonts. No broken aspect ratios. No amateur hour.

Output professional studio jaisa dikhna chahiye.

### 4. Free-First

The core product is free. Forever.

Monetize on scale features, not on basics.

Core product free hai. Hamesha.

## The Opportunity

| Market                             | Size                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Creator economy                    | $250B+ by 2027          |
| Short-form video tools             | Fastest growing segment |
| Long-form to short-form conversion | Largely unserved        |

Long-form content is being created at 10x the rate it's being repurposed.

Every podcast, stream, and webinar is a goldmine of Shorts that will never be made — unless we make it trivially easy.

Long-form content 10x banti hai lekin repurpose nahi hoti. Goldmine of Shorts.

## The Competition

| Competitor   | Strength      | Gap                |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Opus Clip    | AI highlights | No editing control |
| Descript     | Full editing  | Expensive, complex |
| CapCut       | Mobile-first  | Manual everything  |
| Premiere/FCP | Pro-grade     | Hours of work      |

We sit at the intersection: **AI automation + creator control + fast output**.

Automation + control + speed. Yahi sweet spot hai.

---

## The Team

Built by creators who were tired of the 2-hour-to-2-minute grind.

We use our own product. Daily.

Creators ne banaya jo khud 2-hour-to-2-minute grind se thak gaye the.

---

## The Ask

This is v1.

We ship fast. We listen faster.

If you have ideas, bugs, or feedback — open an issue or reach out directly.

Yeh v1 hai. Hum fast ship karte hain. Ideas, bugs, feedback share karo.

## Founder's Note

I built Quick AI Shorts because I was wasting hours every week doing the same repetitive editing.

Find moment. Crop. Caption. Export. Repeat.

It's not creative work. It's assembly line work disguised as content creation.

The tools that exist either do too much (Premiere) or too little (CapCut templates). Nothing hit the sweet spot of "give me the clip, let me polish, get it out."

Quick AI Shorts is that sweet spot.

We're not trying to replace editors. We're trying to eliminate the tasks that don't require human creativity — so humans can focus on the parts that do.

Scale to creators worldwide. Keep it free-first. Keep control in the creator's hands.

That's the vision. Thanks for being here.

Main Quick AI Shorts isliye banaya kyunki har hafte ghanton repetitive editing mein waste ho rahe the. Moment dhoondo. Crop karo. Caption lagao. Export karo. Repeat. Yeh creative work nahi hai. Yeh assembly line hai content creation ki shakal mein. Quick AI Shorts wohi sweet spot hai. Control hamesha creator ke paas.
